Exercise 1: Template Method and Strategy

# Journal
In this excersize, cooming code smells were emmediately seen. 
- Repeated code which violates DRY principle
- Hard to extend and refactor the functionalities due to tight-coupling

The design patterns I've decided to implement are the Strategy pattern and Template pattern.
First, the Strategy pattern was implemented so that we can dynamically switch between different classes when needed, this also makes our code much easier to extend and flexible when we would like to add another play strategy.
